**Main Objective:** The overall objective is to appropriately characterize the physiologic responses that are a result of deception induced stress obtained from wearable and off-body technologies, validate the hallmark metrics obtained by traditional, polygraph sensors against non-traditional sensors, and to develop a model that accurately classifies truth from lie.

**Rationale:** The rationale is motivated by the need for credibility assessment in non-traditional laboratory settings, where the feasibility to deploy conventional techniques requires an overly invasive sensor setup, a highly controlled environment, and experienced personnel.

There exists a critical need for a system that integrates multiple physiological monitoring technologies that expounds upon the current methodologies used in deception detection through the incorporation of additional, unobtrusive sensors, that aim to measure instantaneous stress responses.
