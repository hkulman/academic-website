abstract: Despite prolific demands and sales, commercial sleep assessment is primarily limited by the inability to “measure” sleep itself; rather, secondary physiological signals are captured, combined, and subsequently classified as sleep or a specific sleep state. Using markedly different approaches compared with gold-standard polysomnography, wearable companies purporting to measure sleep have rapidly developed during recent decades. These devices are advertised to monitor sleep via sensors such as accelerometers, electrocardiography, photoplethysmography, and temperature, alone or in combination, to estimate sleep stage based upon physiological patterns. However, without regulatory oversight, this market has historically manufactured products of poor accuracy, and rarely with third-party validation. Specifically, these devices vary in their capacities to capture a signal of interest, process the signal, perform physiological calculations, and ultimately classify a state (sleep vs. wake) or sleep stage during a given time domain. Device performance depends largely on success in all the aforementioned requirements. Thus, this review provides context surrounding the complex hardware and software developed by wearable device companies in their attempts to estimate sleep-related phenomena, and outlines considerations and contributing factors for overall device success.
